## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce you to 3 public health and air quality datasets. These include the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), the EPA's Integrated Compliance Information System for Air (ICIS-AIR), and the CDC's PLACES health outcomes dataset. You will learn how to form queries and retrieve each dataset from their respective API, process the returned object into a useable format, create visualizations and perform simple analysis. You will also use NASA's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to examine socioeconomic patterns in the greater Detroit metropolitan area and explore relationships with public health.
